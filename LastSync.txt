    ddns-scripts: get l3 device for bind network using curl
    
    If pppoe is used for wan access. script set 'eth1' as interface for curl
    call. The correct interface is however 'pppoe-wan'.
    
    These scripts use 'network_get_physdev' function to get real device for
    bind_network but this is wrong. We need instead the l3_device of the the
    logical interface.
    
    In case if we don't use pppoe connection - 'l3_device' is equal to real device.
