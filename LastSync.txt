    ddns-scripts: add support for Porkbun
    
    Extends DDNS support for the Porkbun v3 JSON API with a custom update
    script and service configuration.
    
    See: https://porkbun.com/api/json/v3/documentation
    
    Depends on cURL (with SSL) for transport. Porkbun authentication API keys
    and secret keys are passed through the ddns-scripts "username" and
    "password" variables, respectively. As Porkbun DNS is currently backed by
    Cloudflare, also support ddns-scripts "rec_id" variable for specific
    record targeting.
