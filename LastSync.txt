    php8: adapt test.sh for upcoming opkg -> apk transition
    
    We used to rely on opkg to install the CLI tool for testing
    PHP modules, but when opkg is not available anymore, we have to
    use apk. The (simple) switch logic assumes, that only one
    of both package manager tools is installed.
