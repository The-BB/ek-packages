    modemmanager: add config optional netifd integration
    
    This change introduces an optional configuration
    of the  netifd integration in the ModemManager package.
    When disabled, it removes the NETIFD dependency and
    other unwanted components from the root filesystem
    during the build phase.
    
    Additionally, in the modemmanager.common the netifd-proto.sh
    inclusion line can be savely removed as there is no usage
    of it in its functions.
