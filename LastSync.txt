    coreutils: Adjust coreutils dependency in each app to be selective
    
    Adjust the dependency to the virtual coreutils main package in
    each app to be selective. Otherwise you need to first select the
    main coreutils before the actuall apps can be selected. That has
    prevented other applications from depending on just one individual
    coreutils app, as they have needed to depend also on the empty main
    coreutils package.
