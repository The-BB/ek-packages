    lang/node-* : Disable parallel builds for node packages
    
    Disable parallel builds for node downstream packages, as the
    buildbot is showing frequent timeout problems
    for aarch644, arm, i386 and x86, and node & node packages
    are the primary suspect.
    
    Based on discussion in
