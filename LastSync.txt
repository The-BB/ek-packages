    ksmbd-tools: adjust smb2 max read/write/trans and cache
    
    Now for all devices with every size of RAM it is set to:
    `smb2 max read = 64K`
    `smb2 max write = 64K`
    `smb2 max trans = 64K`
    
    Instead of fixed value to 64K is better to check RAM size and adjust to:
    
    32 ~ 64MB RAM, set the value to 64K
    64 ~ 128MB, set it to 128KB
    128 ~ 256MB, set it to 1MB
    More than 256MB leave default size to 4MB
    
    With 64MB and 128MB is better also to disable the read/write cache
    `cache read buffers = no`
    `cache write buffers = no`
