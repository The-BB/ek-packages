    ci: fix APK version detection
    
    This action was mostly based on the autorelease CI job and somehow there
    is an error that if multiple packages are affected, the path is
    concatenated instead of adding a space.
    
    Secondly the APK return code 0 wasn't good enough for the if condition
    and caused it to trigger even on valid versions.
