    tayga: add options for static mapping
    
    The commit adds options for static mapping, which is essential for
    464xlat(clat) usage. But be noted that routes and firewall rules have
    to be configured manually, for now.
    
    To use tayga as clat/nat46:
    0. specify $ipv4_addr, $prefix, $map_{ipv4,ipv6} properly, and
       set $noroutes to 1 to prevent creating routes for nat64
    1. add custom IPv4 routes to tayga, possibly with a reasonable metric
       for default route
    2. add a SNAT firewall rule for processing IPv4 traffic destined for
       tayga
    3. add firewall rules to allow FORWARD traffic between tayga and WAN6
    4. add a $map_ipv6 route to tayga for guiding return traffic
