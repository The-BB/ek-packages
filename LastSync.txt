    mc: drop patches to handle newer terminfo
    
    This patch was introduced by me in commit
    62513dc57661ac91a4ed7ba1260ebae959c19bbb ("mc: fix mouse handling")
    and that commit backported patch from master branch and it that time,
    there was not any release, which included it.
    Since 4.8.2.5 update, we are still rebasing it, no need to do that.
    
    Fixes: eb0c3b534a7f1676cc49552a3fbac3165e8b37eb ("mc: update to 4.8.25")
