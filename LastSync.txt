    apfree-wifidog: Update to 7.10.2082
    
    Update Makefile to include dependencies: conntrack and libmosquitto.
    
    Conntrack: Added to resolve a bug in Apfree-Wifidog that caused long-lived user connections to persist after logout.
    Libmosquitto: Integrated as a preparatory measure for future support of the MQTT protocol; implementation is still in progress.
    For detailed information, please refer to the release notes:
    https://github.com/liudf0716/apfree-wifidog/releases/tag/7.10.2082.
    
    Additionally, a new /etc/wifidogx directory has been created to store the local authentication portal page for users uploading their own portal pages.
