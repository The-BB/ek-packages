    ipmitool: disable FreeIPMI support
    
    Now that we are building FreeIPMI library ipmitool will detect it
    and since we are already passing --enable-intf-free it will build
    support for FreeIPMI as well.
    
    However, --enable-intf-free was previously no-op since it would just
    fail to detect FreeIPMI and disable support for it but now it seems
    that buildbots build FreeIPMI first and then ipmitool will fail with
    missing dependency on FreeIPMI library.
    
    Since FreeIPMI is quite big and previously ipmitool was built without
    support for it anyway lets disable support for FreeIPMI in ipmitool and
    if its required it can be made optional or as a package variant later.
    
    This fixes building ipmitool via buildbots again.
