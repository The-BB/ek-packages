    shairport-sync: add drift and ALSA mixer config options
    
    Allow setting drift_tolerance_in_seconds, which replaces the
    now-deprecated drift option.
    
    Also allow setting alsa.mixer_control_index, which is necessary to use
    the hardware mixer correctly on some devices (like the Apple USB-C
    Headphone Adapter when a headset is plugged in).
