    perl-html-parser: add perl/host to HOST_BUILD_DEPENDS
    
    Added `perl/host` to the `HOST_BUILD_DEPENDS` variable to ensure Perl is available during the host build process.
    This is required for scripts or tools that rely on Perl on the host system.
    
    Fixes: ebfb47aa7448d46f950164e9d5835da5151182b1 ("perl-html-parser: restructure and update to 3.83")
