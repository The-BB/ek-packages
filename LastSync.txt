    strongswan: swanctl: make overtime local
    
    $overtime has been used since swanctl.init was added in f9d91f1f47.
    However, there's no need for it to be global.  Make it local like the
    other config variables to avoid polluting the global namespace and make
    the code easier to reason about.
    
    Fixes: f9d91f1f470a ("strongswan: migrate to swanctl configs")
