    xtables-addons: remove not needed iptables install dependency for RTSP helpers
    
    The RTSP conntrack and nat does not dependent on iptables, but only on
    nf_conntrack and nf_nat. The RTSP conntrack module is used as a helper in
    firewall4 [1]. Previously, it was not possible to install RTSP kernel module
    without also installing the not needed iptables modules. However, as firewall4
    is based on nftables and not on iptables, this dependency is not necessary.
